# callr

This is an experimental project to support calling R from a D program. It's experimental because:

- I plan to make changes.
- The parts worth keeping will make it back into [embedrv2](https://github.com/bachmeil/embedrv2)

Much of this functionality has been publicly available for many years. I want to clean things up, and I might have to break a few things in the process. Some of the names reflect this (e.g., `RArrayInsideR`).
